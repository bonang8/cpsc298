  Instructions:
  It is difficult to make a budget that spans several years, because prices are
  not stable. If your company needs 200 pencils per year, you cannot simply use
  this yearâ€™s price as the cost of pencils two years from now. Because of
  inflation the cost is likely to be higher than it is today. Write a program to
  gauge the expected cost of an item in a specified number of years. The program
  asks for the cost of the item, the number of years from now that the item will
  be purchased, and the rate of inflation. The program then outputs the
  estimated cost of the item after the specified period. Have the user enter the
  inflation rate as a per- centage, such as 5.6 (percent). Your program should
  then convert the percentage to a fraction, such as 0.056, and should use a
  loop to estimate the price adjusted for inflation. (Hint: Use a loop.)
